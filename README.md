# 🏦 MQLITE Bank: Customer Segmentation Dashboard (Power BI)

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the MQLITE Bank customer base, segmenting customers by demographics, income, loyalty status, and professional profile to enable data-driven marketing and personalization strategies.

## 🚀 Project Goal

## ✨ Key Metrics & Segmentation Results

The dashboard captures the following core metrics:

* **Average Tenure:** 5 Years

### Loyalty Breakdown:
* **Loyal:** 40% (Target for high-value services)
* **Emerging:** (Needs active nurturing)
* **New:** (Focus on onboarding success)
* **Legacy:** (High potential risk/reward segment)

## 🛠️ Tools and Methodology
